Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account. We may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Transaction and experience information: </strong>When you use our Services or access our Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, the amount paid for products or services, merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information.</p></li>

                                        <ul className="privacy-inner-list">
                                            <li><i>Send or request money:</i> When you send or request money through the Services, we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you.

                                            <li><i>Add value to your accounts: </i>If you use our Services to add value to your Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about you to facilitate the request. For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone, or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other information including mobile account number from the other participant.</li>

                                <li><p><strong>Information about your public profile and your friends and contacts:</strong> It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you choose to connect your contact list information with your Account or if your Account profile is publicly available. If you establish an account connection between your device or a social media platform and your Account, we will use your contact list information (such as name, address, email address) to improve your experience when you use the Services. When your Account profile is public, other users can find your profile to send you money by searching for you by name, username, email, or mobile number on OnePurse and confirm itâ€™s you by viewing your photo. You can make your Account profile private anytime in your settings page.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Information that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services or specific online Services:</strong> If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you.
